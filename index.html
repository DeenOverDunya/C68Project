Pates is an excellent school for many but not all. It has a culture of hard work, both academic and sports wise, which can be difficult for some students to deal with. If the student likes studies and can deal with workloads or is study orientated, then Pates is ideal. It has waves of work balanced with free time from homework, which gives for an outstanding learning environment preparing the child for university in later life. It's almost a private school and parental involvement is essential as too support to ensure all the children and young adults whom study get the very best support and teachings. Exceptional management makes  for an environment of happiness and as the child progresses, through its education personal abilities are also nurtured, be them art, sports, academic studies or language skills with inter schools interactions, companies like GCHQ visits, or overseas trips of discovery.

After a week of heats and finals, House Athletics finally reached its climax during 2 days of top athletics and 5 records being broken - all by Year 8 students. After the fierce and exciting finals and relays, all the points were added up and the Sports Day 2022 Shield was presented by Mr Ellicott to Richmond House.</p>

    <p class="text-muted"> House Swimming Gala was back with a splash! Competed over two consecutive Tuesdays, 8th and 15th February. The structure of the gala involves two students per house competing in different strokes , with two five person heats and competitors swimming as fast as possible to post a time. This year we saw officials sporting Pyjamas to Superheroes and all in between!

        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize  "> I Participated In 2018!</h5>
        <p class="text-muted"> There was great excitement following the announcement that the Bake Off is Back! It was fantastic to see the number of pupils who wanted to get involved, with some form groups even arranging mini Bake-Off’s to decide who would be representing them.  The tightly contested Signature Bake round saw the three categories produce either cookies, cupcakes or traybakes. The judging panels, made up of enthusiastic teachers, really struggled to decide on the top 5 for each category. However, those bakers who were selected were then tasked with baking an extravaganza for their Showstopper! For the Juniors (Y7-8) is was a Christmas decorated sponge cake; for the Intermediates (Y9-11) it was a Fantasy Cake; and for the Seniors (Y12-13) it was a triple layered Celebration cake.

<p> Welcome to Pate’s. We are a unique and special school. Founded back in 1574, today we are a selective co-educational grammar school that cherishes and treasures our rich tradition, yet we are also known both regionally and nationally for being forward-thinking and leading the way with educational developments.

    Come and visit us and from the moment you step inside you will recognise a school built on relationships and respect rather than rules. Our school community shares a vision of "Nurturing Excellence" through "Embracing Challenge", "Supporting Each Other" and "Shaping the Future". Our academic outcomes are exceptional, however our community is about far more than just qualifications. As a school we are on a journey to being "World Class" in the broadest sense. Learning in this context is not just about outcomes, but also about how you get there. Our students are encouraged to be happy, independent and curious, resilient, creative and enquiring. It is these skills that set Pate’s students apart and that facilitate access to the very best universities both here in the U.K. and abroad.
    
    At Pate’s students work hard, but play hard too. Our extra and super curricular offerings are unrivalled in the state sector. Our school House System is the heartbeat of the school and is just one example of the way in which we both support pupils pastorally and also develop student leadership skills. The Pate’s community is culturally rich and diverse, welcoming students from a phenomenal range of backgrounds. As a school we recognise and celebrate this, helping each individual to "be the me I choose to be".</p>
